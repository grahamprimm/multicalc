2. **Functionality:** The user should be able to choose between four calculators: Temperature Conversion, Compound Interest, Currency Converter, and Slope of a Line.
3. **Organization:** Each calculator should have its own dedicated area within the interface.
4. **Interactivity:** The user should be able to input values, and see results within the same window.
5. **Error Handling:** The application should handle invalid inputs gracefully and provide feedback to the user.
